# Template file for use in drupal projects
version: '2'
services:
# Define the container for Apache webserver and expose the most important volumes:
# - the web directory (not the webroot, but this will be a subdir of the web directory)
# - the logfiles of the webserver
# - the settings directory for the drupal console
# - the settings directory for drush
# - a directory for additional bash settings (e.g. bash setting for drush and drupal console)
# - It shares the volumes from the drush and drupalconsole services so that it seems that drush
#   and drupalconsole are installed within this container.
# - It links to the mysql service to make the service accessible from here (hostname is service name)
